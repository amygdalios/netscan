# netscan



This script isn't anything crazy it's a really simple script I created when i started learning python and started getting into cyber security.

The purpose of this script is to scan every device on a network and based on its mac address find the vendor of that device.

It has alot of bugs and very unoptimised. I am not sure if i will fix the bugs and optimise it down the line but i just thought id upload this project as something i can look back on and remember where i started.
